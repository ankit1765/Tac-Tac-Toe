# Tic Tac Toe

This is a widely known game of Tic Tac Toe. The game is on Command Line, so it uses several fundamentals of
python, including but not limited to, tuples, lists, time and random Python library functions, for / while loops.

This was my first time creating some sort of AI, where the computer uses an algorithm to decide the position
in order to win the game, or at least block your chance of winning. Note that the algorithm incorporates a decision
to make sure the computer prioritizes its own winning over blocking the user if it had the choice between the two
in one turn. A list of possible cases where the CP can win, or lose was created. I implemented a method to go through
the list and decide when/how to execute the solution to a new situation (win or block), and ignore the old situations
that had already been dealt with.

As in any Tic Tac Toe game already on the market (App Stores, Web Apps, etc), the user has a choice of going first or
second, and to play again after the game has completed.
